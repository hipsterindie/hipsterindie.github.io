        <p> hi. my name is David! i began considering programming seriously for my career in 2021. this started with a half-assed attempt to create a website using vscode, git, and github. this website quickly fell out of my sights, as i was quite inexperienced and unfamiliar with these tools. i had a decent background in mathematics during highschool (2014-2017) and community college (2017-2022), and began studying computer engineering at Oakland University (2022-2024). at the moment, im looking for full-time work related to my field of study; in the meantime, i keep myself busy with interests, hobbies, family, and friends. </p>
        
        <!-- begin subsections about different aspects of my life? (i.e., hobbies, family, friends, )-->
        <!-- interests: what i would like to further;
            hobbies: what i have currently integrated in my routine;
            family: people i live with/persisted in my life 
            friends: people persisted in my life/have crossed meaningful paths with-->
