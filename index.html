     <p>There is <big>alot</big> to <small>know</small> about <b><i>me</i></b>, but we will get to that <i>later</i>.</p>
     <p>For now, I'll just be using this to learn more about HTML as well as practice.</p>

     <h2 style="color: green;">Styles and Colors</h2>
     <p style="color: red; background-color:blue;">We can style and color our HTML webpage. There is an entire other subject called CSS
     that can be used to do more with HTML. We will only work on the basics now. If we type "style" in our paragraph tag, we can color our
     text, as well as background color. By applying it to the body section of our code, we can change the entire color of the text,
     or in this case, the background. The other background color overrides the body's style.</p>
     <br/>
     <p> Hopefully you can see how many things can be created <big><i>already</i></big> with what we've learned!</p>

     <h2 style="color: charcoal;">Formatting</h2>
     <p>As we can see in the code, we have some new tags that involve organization. This helps allow code to be read easier or found
     quicker by yourself or some future developers, as well as being used in search engine optimization. Some more tags we've
     used are <i>headers</i> and <i>footers</i>, which usually contain <i>nav</i> tags, which allows for easy navigation throughout the website.
     there is also the <i>main</i>, which holds the majority of text. We use the <i>article</i> tag for the text of, let's say a blog post.
     This should(?) hold all our text of the blog or article. This can further be broken down with <i>section</i> tags. These section tags
     should have headers. <i>We can use our header in a hierarchy fashion. This is only recommended, not required.</i>
     We also have an <i>aside</i> tag that can be used for stuff not directly used on the page. Maybe an advertisement like
     Google AdSense. And again, this section is mainly for the layout of the HTML file, so these structure tags help make it easier to tell
     just <i>what</i> is going on. These aren't needed but it's a very handy set of tools. The basic idea with search engine optimization
     is that if our website has good search engine optimization, it makes it easier for search engines like Google to read through the site
     and figure out just what your website is about.</p>
     <p> I'll take a break for now!</p>
